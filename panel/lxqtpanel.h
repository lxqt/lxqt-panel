/*! \brief The LXQtPanel class provides a single lxqt-panel. All LXQtPanel
 * instances should be created and handled by LXQtPanelApplication. In turn,
 * all Plugins should be created and handled by LXQtPanels.
 *
 * LXQtPanel is just the panel, it does not incorporate any functionality.
 * Each function of the panel is implemented by Plugins, even the mainmenu
 * (plugin-mainmenu) and the taskbar (plugin-taskbar). So the LXQtPanel is
 * just the container for several Plugins while the different Plugins
 * incorporate the functions of the panel. Without the Plugins, the panel
 * is quite useless because it is just a box occupying space on the screen.
 *
 * LXQtPanel itself is a window (QFrame/QWidget) and this class is mainly
 * responsible for handling the size and position of this window on the
 * screen(s) as well as the different settings. The handling of the plugins
 * is outsourced in PanelPluginsModel and LXQtPanelLayout. PanelPluginsModel
 * is responsible for loading/creating and handling the plugins.
 * LXQtPanelLayout is inherited from QLayout and set as layout to the
 * background of LXQtPanel, so LXQtPanelLayout is responsible for the
 * layout of all the Plugins.
 *
 * \sa LXQtPanelApplication, Plugin, PanelPluginsModel, LXQtPanelLayout.
